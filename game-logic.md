The game starts after a character is chosen. A modal will appear with 3 characters to choose from.
The player will have 3 lives (hearts).
I need to write the classes for enemies, player, and maybe collectibles (gems and key).
The player will start from the same location. He moves with the up, down, left and right arrows. He must not be able to move off screen.
When the player collides with one of the enemies, he loses a life, and moves to the initial position.
When the player wins, a modal appears with a message and a button to restart game.
